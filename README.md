# Gameplay


You are lost in a museum.

Navigate from a painting to another in order to find your way out.

### Controls

- desktop : use the mouse + space to move forward 
- mobile : use the gyroscope + touch the screen to move forward 
- cardboard : use the gyroscope + magnetic button to move forward

# Inspiration

I challenge myself to put as much image as possible in the game, in form of widly known piece of art.

To do so, I used a genetic algorithm to describe an arbitrary image as a set of colored dot.

# Map Edit

It have some pretty cool features, such as 
- 📏 intuitive UI
- 🎥 live reloading
- 💽 localstorage persistance
